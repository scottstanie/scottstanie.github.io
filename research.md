My research uses satellite radar interferometry [(InSAR)](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/ca-water-ls/science/interferometric-synthetic-aperture-radar-insar?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects) to measure millimeter-level changes to Earth's surface over time.
InSAR has a huge variety of [geophysical applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometric_synthetic-aperture_radar#Applications), like mapping ground deformation due to the 2018 eruption of Kilauea:

As a member of the algorithm development team for the [OPERA project at JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/opera), I have been working on the North American Surface Displacement products, which will be a free and open dataset of ground deformation from Sentinel-1 and NISAR.

During my Ph.D., I used InSAR to monitor surface changes over the Permian Basin in West Texas. I worked with geologists and seismologists to better understand the causes of the induced earthquakes associated with oil and gas production.

<!-- Below is an interactive map to play around with the cumulative vertical deformation between November 2014 and January 2019 from our paper:

>Staniewicz et al., "InSAR reveals complex surface deformation patterns over an 80,000 square kilometer oil-producing region in the Permian Basin", Geophysical Research Letters (2020): 2020GL090151 

The red areas show uplift (up to ~7cm), blue areas show subsidence (down to ~13 cm), and dark red dots are the locations of the [TexNet](https://www.beg.utexas.edu/texnet/catalog) detected earthquakes in 2018.
You can also download all the deformation data products shown in the paper [at the Texas data repository](https://doi.org/10.18738/T8/AVDBOJ)
