My research at UT with the Center for Space research centers around satellite radar interferometry [(InSAR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometric_synthetic-aperture_radar).
This is a technique where radar satellite images from different times a compared, and the change in ground elevation can be found with millimeter-level accuracy.

Some of the applications include mapping subsidence and ground patterns from earthquakes, like the 2018 eruption of Kilauea:
