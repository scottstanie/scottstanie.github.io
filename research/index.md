My research at UT with the Center for Space research centers around satellite radar interferometry [(InSAR)](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/ca-water-ls/science/interferometric-synthetic-aperture-radar-insar?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects).
This is a technique that can sense millimeter-level changes in the ground over time.
InSAR has a huge variety of [geophysical applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometric_synthetic-aperture_radar#Applications), like mapping ground changes due like the 2018 eruption of Kilauea:

My main Ph.D. project has used InSAR to monitor surface changes over the Permian Basin in West Texas to help understand the causes of the induced earthquakes associated with oil and gas production.

Below is an interactive map to play around with the cumulative vertical deformation between November 2014 and January 2019 from our paper:

>Staniewicz et al., "InSAR reveals complex surface deformation patterns over an 80,000 square kilometer oil-producing region in the Permian Basin", Geophysical Research Letters (2020): 2020GL090151 

The red areas show uplift (up to ~7cm), blue areas show subsidence (down to ~13 cm), and dark red dots are the locations of the [TexNet](https://www.beg.utexas.edu/texnet/catalog) detected earthquakes in 2018.
You can also download all the deformation data products shown in the paper [at the Texas data repository](https://doi.org/10.18738/T8/AVDBOJ)
