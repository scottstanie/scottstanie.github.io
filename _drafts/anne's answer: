    would like to see a historical view of the aggregate effort put towards each of these
    seems like it would be a good way to measure a society
    seems like it would completely dictate what comes out (dearth of new creative products cuz so many people are on the work grind)

    Only a subset of people get this choice (people born well, very smart, high performers, etc.). How do their choices then trickle down to the rest of society by setting what people value?
