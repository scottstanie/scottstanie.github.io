# Graphs in python

## Depth First Search

Idea of algorithm:

```
1. Start with a node to search from, and mark it as 'searched'
2. Visit one of the neighboring nodes and mark it
3. Visit some neighbor node until there are none you haven't visited, then go to next neighbor node from (2)
4. Continue until all are marked
```
