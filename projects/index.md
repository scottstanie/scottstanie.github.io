### [Codenames](http://codenames.scottstaniewicz.com)

Play codenames at home with friends.

No copyright intended.
I tried to ask [Czech Games](https://www.czechgames.com/) if they wanted to take it, but they said "No."

### [One Night Werewolf](http://wolf.scottstaniewicz.com)

At a certain point during 2016, my friends and I played One Night Ultimate Werewolf so much that we were annoyed we had not kept stats (how else can you really know if you're a good liar?).
So I made a real-time updating web app to run through the game setup.

Unfortunately, we were already too tired of lying to our friends at that point for the game to get much use.

### 2013 Senior Project

A drone chases around [ArUco Markers](https://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/d5/dae/tutorial_aruco_detection.html), trying to navigate and find its place in this world.
