[Having Kids - Paul Graham](https://www.paulgraham.com/kids.html)
Highlights:
> To most 6 year olds, 2 year olds are just defective 6 year olds

My version of this with a 6-month-old: 

- The 6- and 8-year-old cousins absolutely adored meeting her, wanted to take care of her, even wanted to help change her diaper and feed her.
- Her 4-year-old cousin is also warming up to her: he's getting excited about the idea of teaching her things in the future, and likes when she grabs his finger.
- To her 2-year-old cousin... she's just defective.

Another parenting reflection essay. My favorite section

> this is a totally normal number of problems for them to have. Additionally:
> - If your baby goes minutes at a time [without blinking](https://www.livescience.com/62988-why-babies-rarely-blink.html), and sometimes never seems to blink at all, that's normal.
> - If your baby [randomly stops breathing](https://myhealth.alberta.ca/Health/aftercareinformation/pages/conditions.aspx?hwid=abr3128&) sometimes, that's normal.
> - If one of your (male) baby's nipples is much bigger and harder than the other, that's normal.    
> - If that nipple, and only that nipple, on your (male) baby, starts producing milk, that's normal too.
> - If people [call it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch's_milk) "witchâ€™s milk" and [claim that](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4422278/) "goblins feed on it", that's the most normal thing of all.
