title: Claude loves em-dashes, o3 is a liar

> The use of an em dash is a dead giveaway someone used ChatGPT to write for them

This came from my friend to our text group. I've seen this opinion start to pop up more online — and for good reason. 

Now that we've gotten that out of the way, I did have a funny experience with the models drooling over em-dashes:

I feedback on a new section of my CV, so I pasted the text to both Claude and o3 asking for opinions. Then, I pasted their answers to one another, and asked “is yours better? Or this other version?”

Humble Claude thought ChatGPT was better... because it used em-dashes:

Now, it just so happened that ChatGPT also fabricated all the numbers on the resume and left it unusable. When I pointed that out, Claude agreed that its version was better.

All I could think of was this scene from American Psycho:
