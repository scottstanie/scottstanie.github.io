Here is an example of Breadth First Search to traverse a graph and find all possible paths. The graph here is a representation of a 4x4 chess board in the game of [chess solitaire](http://www.thinkfun.com/microsite/solitairechess/demo). The pieces are standard chess pieces. The only legal moves are captures of other pieces. Pawns only being able to move downward. 
The board starts in a random configuration, and the objective of the puzzle is to be left with only one piece.
