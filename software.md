title: "Open Source Software"
---

Below are some of the open-source software projects I have developed for radar remote sensing.

### [dolphin](https://github.com/isce-framework/dolphin)

A Python package implementing advanced multi-temporal "PS/DS" (combined Persistent Scatterer/Distributed Scatterer) processing and phase linking algorithms.
This library is the core of software used to generate the OPERA North America Surface Displacement product.

### [sentineleof](https://github.com/scottstanie/sentineleof)

A lightweight library for downloading Sentinel-1 precise orbit files.  
Designed for robust integration in large-scale processing pipelines.

### [sardem](https://github.com/scottstanie/sardem)

Small tool to set up a local digital elevation models (DEM) from SAR/InSAR processing.

I have also maintain or contribute to dozens of open source packages, including those in the [isce-framework](https://github.com/isce-framework) and [opera-adt](https://github.com/opera-adt) organizations, as well as popular Python and geospatial packages such as [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax), [xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray), and [GDAL](https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal).
See my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/scottstanie) for the full list.
