      <h2>What is Flask</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/">Flask</a> is an example of a Python <strong><em>web application framework</em></strong>. Specifically, it calls itself a <em>microframework</em> because it provides less up front. Before we dive in to how to use flask, let's take a step back and look at what a the very basics of how the internet works so you know what a <strong>web application</strong> consists of, and why you'd want to use a <strong>web framework</strong> to make one.</p>

<h2>The Internet in brief</h2>

<p>The crux of how the internet works in most sites (in two steps):<br/>
- A client sends a request to visit some website<br/>
- A serve sends back some files to display in the browser<br/>
If you understand that, you can skip to the next section. For slightly more details*:</p>

<p>The internet is a global network of computers, each with a specific address. These addresses look something like xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, x being a number from 0-255.  When you go to your browser and type <code>www.google.com</code>, you are sending a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP**) request that says "Send me the data from the IP address with the name google.com". Then your request goes to a <strong>domain name service</strong> (DNS) which keeps track of the IP address for <code>google.com</code>. To see this, type fewuhaof.com, and you will get a DNS error, since there is no address for that gibberish name. Once the DNS gets the address you need, your ISP can send your request to the right computer.<br/>
So if that is all that happens on your end when you type <code>google.com</code>, what is the thing that responded on the other end? That is where a <strong>web server</strong> comes in. Once your request to <code>GET</code> the data from <code>google.com</code> reached the right IP address, it was met by a <em>server</em>, which is just a computer located somewhere that is connected to the internet and sits waiting for incoming requests. Once it receives a request like yours (to <code>GET google.com</code>), it will send back the files needed to show the Google web page, which are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.</p>

<p>*<a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/msande91si/www-spr04/readings/week1/InternetWhitepaper.htm">For an even more detailed overview of the internet, see here.</a><br/>
**Note: Don't confuse HTTP with HTML. HTTP is a <em>protocol</em>: it gives directions to computers on how to talk to each other over the internet. <em>HTML</em> is HyperText Markup Language, which is just text with some directions to a browser on how to display properly like a web page.</p>

<h2>What is a web app?</h2>

<p>Where does a web app come into the picture described above? Once the server has received your request to see a page, it translates the request to the web app to process. Thus, the web app is the program that runs and decides what should be done with every user that visits a website. For simple static websites (ones that just show an HTML page with no user inputs), that program in Python could look as simple as:</p>

<pre><code>def serve_page():
  return "&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;Hello, World.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"
</code></pre>

<p>This function would be called each time a visitor requests the page, and it would send back the barebones HTML to display "Hello, World."<br/>
Naturally, this examples ignores a lot of other code that needs to run to accept the request and talk to the server to send back the info. There is a lot of boilerplate code that goes into every application that needs to run on the internet, and this is where web application <em>frameworks</em> come in.</p>

<h3>Web application frameworks</h3>

<p>So now what is a <strong>web application framework</strong>? <a href="http://www.fullstackpython.com/web-frameworks.html">As described here</a>, web frameworks are reusable code libraries that make it easier to build a reliable, scalable, and maintainable web app. They help reuse code common for HTTP operations</p>
