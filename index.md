Hi, I'm Scott.
I'm currently in grad school at UT Austin working for the [radar interferometry group](http://sites.utexas.edu/annchen/) in the [Center for Space Research](https://www.csr.utexas.edu/).
Before that I was in Cambridge and working at [Cogo Labs](http://cogolabs.com) for a few years, and I graduated from Tufts University with degrees in Electrical Engineering and Mathematics.

Outside of school and work, I enjoy cooking (see [nomplan's hall of fame](http://www.nomplan.life/scores/)), hiking, travel, and various athletic pursuits.


The best way to get in contact with me is via [email](mailto:scott.stanie@gmail.com), but you can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/scott-staniewicz) or [GitHub](https://github.com/scottstanie).
