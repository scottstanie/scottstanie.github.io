Hi, I'm Scott.
I'm currently a Staff Radar Engineer at <a href="https://www.capellaspace.com/" target="_blank">Capella Space</a>, specializing in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry.
Before that, I was a Signal Analysis Engineer at NASA <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> in the SAR Algorithms group.
I finished my Ph.D. at UT Austin in 2022 in the <a href="http://sites.utexas.edu/annchen/" target="_blank">radar interferometry group</a>, part of the <a href="https://www.csr.utexas.edu/" target="_blank">Center for Space Research</a>.
